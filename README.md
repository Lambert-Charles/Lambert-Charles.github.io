MY ONLINE CURRICULUM
====================

Many thanks to jeromelachaud (https://jeromelachaud.com),
I used his Freelancer Jekyll theme and customized it to make this CV in html.

I didn't use it as a Jekyll template because I found it uneasy to customize to my taste. 
Instead I used it as a classic html-css-js template and worked from there.

Hope you like it. I'll make sure to update it with the projects I'll be working on.
Happy coding!
